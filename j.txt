Jubilant jingles jauntily jangle from the jukebox, jolting the joyous jockeys into a jig. Jaunty jazz and jazzy jams jump from the speakers, joining the jubilant jeers of the jovial jesters. Jittery jokesters join in the jamboree, joining the joyful jubilation of the joyous gathering. Jocose japes and jocular jests are shared, as the joyous jubilee continues on into the night.
