Keenly kiting, the kite-keeper kept a keen eye on the kites. Kicking off the kite-flying, he knotted the kite strings and kept them knotted. Keeping his kite-flying kit close, he kept a keen watch on the kites as they kited through the sky. Kicking up a kaleidoscope of colors, the kites kept their kaleidoscopic pattern as they kept on kiting. Keeping his kit close, the kite-keeper kept his kites in the sky.
