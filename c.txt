Crisp clouds crept across the cerulean sky, casting a cool chill across the countryside. Cows cackled contentedly as they chewed their cud, while cats curled up in the corner of the cottage. The children clambered around the courtyard, chasing each other in circles and cackling with delight. The sun crested the horizon, casting a comforting warmth across the countryside and bringing a close to the day.
