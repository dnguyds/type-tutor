The Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus), commonly known as the peacock, is a large, colorful bird native to India. It is one of the most recognizable and popular birds in the world, and is featured in many myths and legends. The male has an extravagant tail composed of highly elongated upper-tail covert feathers, which spread out in a distinctive train that is more than 60% of the total body length. The brightly colored train feathers have distinctive eye markings of blue, gold, red, and other hues. The female lacks the train, but has a crest and a white neck ring.
