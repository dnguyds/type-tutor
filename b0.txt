The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also called the lesser panda, the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear, is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front legs. It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is an excellent climber and can rotate its ankle to descend trees head-first. It is also an excellent swimmer. The red panda is the only living species of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae. Its closest relative is the giant panda of the family Ursidae.
