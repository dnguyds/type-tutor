Frolicking ferrets frolicked fervently in the field, frolicking far from the farmhouse. Fanciful furry friends frolicked freely, flitting from flower to flower. Frolicking ferrets found fun and frolic in the fragrant foliage, frolicking for hours in the fresh, fragrant field. Finally, the ferrets finished their frolicking and fled to their farmhouse.
