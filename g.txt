Gathering gregarious gophers, the garrulous gardener gleefully grinned. Glancing at the grassy ground, he grabbed his gardening gloves and got to work. Guiding the gophers to their new home, he graciously gave them a grand tour. Gently grooming the garden, he grew gladder and gladder as the greenery grew. Glowing with pride, he gazed at his glorious garden with great satisfaction.
