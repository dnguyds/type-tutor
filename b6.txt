The kiwi (Apteryx spp.) is a flightless bird native to New Zealand. It is the national symbol of New Zealand and is also the country's most iconic bird species. Kiwis are unusual in many ways; they are nocturnal, have highly developed senses of smell and hearing, and have no visible wings or tail. They are also one of few birds with nostrils at the end of their beak. Kiwis lay the largest eggs relative to their body size of any bird species in the world.
