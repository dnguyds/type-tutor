The Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata), also known as the snow monkey, is a terrestrial Old World monkey species that is native to Japan. They are the northernmost non-human primate in the world. The species lives in large matriarchal troops that forage in various habitats such as mountainous areas and hot springs. These macaques have adapted to cold temperatures and snowfall in their environment, hence their name. Their diet consists of fruits, leaves, flowers, invertebrates, and small vertebrates.
