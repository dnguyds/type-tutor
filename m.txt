Musing merrily, Mary marched merrily down the meandering mountain path. Making her way through the mossy meadows, she marveled at the magnificent mountainside. Marveling at the majestic magnolias, Mary mused on the marvelous majesty of nature. Moving onward, Mary meandered through the meadows until she reached her destination. Making her way back home, Mary was mesmerized by the marvelous mountain scenery.
