Presently, Peter purchased a plethora of pungent peppers from the produce purveyor. Preparing the peppers, he peeled and pared them, then placed them in a pot with plenty of piquant paprika. Peter proceeded to pour in a pool of piquant pepper sauce, and then poached the peppers until they were perfectly plump. Pleased with his progress, Peter proceeded to plate the peppers and enjoy his peppery creation.
