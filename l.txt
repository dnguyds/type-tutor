Languidly lolling in the lush lawn, Larry lounged lazily, letting the languid light lull him into a lazy lethargy. Leaning back, he let his limbs lay limp, luxuriating in the languid lull of the late afternoon. Languidly lapping against the lake's lapping shoreline, a light breeze lightly lifted Larry's locks. Lulled into a lazy lethargy, Larry lay there, letting the languid light lull him into a peaceful slumber.
