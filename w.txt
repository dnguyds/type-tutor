Wandering through the woods, William watched the wildlife with wonder. Whistling winds whipped through the trees, while wildflowers waved in the breeze. Wispy clouds waltzed across the sky, while a woodpecker whacked away nearby. With a warm welcome, the woods wrapped around William, and he was content to wander within its walls.
